SISL (Simple Iterative Solver Library) is a set of simple routines for
matrix multiplication and iterative solution of linear systems. It is
mainly implemented as a wrappers for calls to the BLAS. To install it
you will need to have installed:

  glib (or glib-2.0) to provide portability and other utility
  functions (this should be available on most GNU/Linux systems);

  WMPI to handle parallel calculations (even if you do not intend to
  do parallel runs);

  GSL (GNU Scientific Library) to provide the complex data type;

  BLAS to do the computations;
