Tests should be done in this order, for real and complex cases:

Matrix-vector multiplication;

Matrix-matrix multiplication (dense-dense);

Matrix-matrix multiplications (sparse-dense, and v.v.), checked
against dense-dense method;

Matrix-matrix multiplications (diagonal-dense, and v.v.), checked
against dense-dense method;

Matrix-matrix multiplications (diagonal-sparse, and v.v.), checked
against sparse-dense method;

Repeat for combinations of transpositions
