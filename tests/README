The easiest way to run the tests is to use the test-all script.

Otherwise, tests should be done in this order, for real and complex
cases:

Matrix-vector multiplication;

Matrix-matrix multiplication;

[these two use external data to check the dense matrix multiplication
routines, so that the dense routines can be used thereafter to check
the other functions, using internally-generated random matrices]

Matrix inversion, checked by computing the product of the matrix and
its inverse

Matrix-matrix multiplications (sparse/dense/diagonal), checked
against dense-dense method;

Matrix-matrix triple multiplications (sparse/dense/diagonal), checked
against dense-dense method;
